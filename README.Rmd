## Housing and Urban Development in R

* This interface uses the HUD User Data API but is not endorsed or certified by HUD User.

The goal of this project is to provide an easy-to-use interface to access
various open-source APIs provided by the U.S Housing and Urban Development. 
These include the USPS Crosswalk Files, Fair Markets Rent, Income Limits, and
Comprehensive Housing and Affordability Strategy. Although HUD does provide 
datasets for other programs, they are currently not supported by an API. 

HUD has two websites for gaining access to various data sets:
HUD User and Exchange.

Please read https://www.huduser.gov/portal/dataset/api-terms-of-service.html
for all terms of service.

According to HUD USER:

All services, which utilize or access the API, should display the following
notice prominently within the application: "This product uses the HUD User Data
API but is not endorsed or certified by HUD User." You may use the HUD User name
in order to identify the source of API content subject to these rules. You may
not use the HUD User name, or the like to imply endorsement of any product,
service, or entity, not-for-profit, commercial or otherwise.

## HUD User: https://www.huduser.gov/portal/datasets

According to (HUD User Home Page | HUD USER), HUD User is a U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development information source that includes reports and
reference documents. HUD USER was founded in 1978 by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development's Office of Policy Development and Research.

HUD User maintains an API to gain access to their data. However, their API
system can be confusing and provides their information in JSON format 
rather than a data-frame like object. Although there exist file downloadables,
R users may want to be able to extract specific bits of the data into memory.

## HUD Exchange: https://www.hudexchange.info/programs/drgr/

According to (Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System, 2022), HUD Exchange is a
comprehensive online platform that provides tools, resources, and contact
information for organizations and individuals who engage with HUD. Nonprofit
organizations and state and municipal governments are frequently included, but
borrowers, lenders, and brokers involved in HUD's multifamily loan programs are
also included.

The DRGR Disaster Recovery Grant Reporting System which HUD Exchange uses to
supply public data does not have an active API for retrieving information.
However, there does exist data sets freely available online which can be
directly downloadable into R. This package provides the ability to directly get
such data.
